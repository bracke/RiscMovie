# RiscMovie
RiscMovie keeps track of your movie collection. For each movie you can set the genre, mediatype, audio tracks and subtitles. Each movie can have up to 3 titles (e.g. original and English). Multiple lists can be open at the same time and lists can be sorted and searched.

NOTE: This is a RISC OS app and will not run on other platforms.
